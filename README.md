# ValheimMods
Random mods I felt like making for the game Valheim

## InfiniteTorchMod:
Keeps Torches & Campfires at full fuel capacity

## PvPNoSkillDrain:
Prevents stat loss upon death with PvP is enabled
This is mainly just to make PvP matches viable without the fear of losing stats

## UsefulTrophies
Allows the player to consume trophy items to gain random stats
Amount of xp gained is configurable, along with the option to disable boss trophy consumption
